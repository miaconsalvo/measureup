    -> Hi, nice to meet you!
    -> How are you doing?
        Heather: A bit nervous, to be honest, but also excited.
Heather: Jo told me you were going to ask me some questions before we dive into the makeover.
Heather: Should we just dive right in?

Heather: Well, with the kids at school and in after school sports and activities I usually go with comfort over anything else. 
Heather: Yoga pants are my go to. Usually a [tag]T-Shirt[/tag] with it, and then sneakers. 
Heather: It's a pretty basic vibe.

Heather: That's easy. Skirts.
Heather: I hated when wardrobe would put the big frilly and flashy ones on me as Jenny on The Family Tree.
Heather: I think that has stuck with me ever since. 
Heather: It made sense for the character, I guess, but as a kid I haaaated them.
<<add_note 1 1>>
Heather: Especially the really brightly coloured ones.

Heather: Hmm... like worn the most? Or what I love for its style the most?
-> What you wear the the most.
    Heather: That would be my tried and true black yoga pants.
    Heather: I think I own like 5 pairs of the same ones. 
    Heather: Actually. I almost bought some patterned ones a few weeks ago, but I don't know if I can pull them off.
    <<add_note 2 2>>
-> What you love the most, regardless of how often you wear it. 
    Heather:  I have a designer letterman-style jacket that I'll wear to the kids games that they got me (well their dad did, but you know how it goes!). 
    Heather: I love that it's practical but I still feel stylish in it - the sleeves have this cool floral pattern on it.
    Heather: It isn't something I would usually choose for myself so it was a great gift.

Heather: I'd like to feel like I have an outfit or style beyond the school run mom.
Heather: As much as I live and die by my athleisure wardrobe, I know I can pull off some other looks - I just need a helping hand.

Heather: I had to wear a blazer and suit pants to court, thanks to some actions of an old co-star who needed a character witness for a custody case.
Heather: That day cost him two favours because I despise uncomfy, stuffy clothes, and dealing with lawyers, haha!
